Did you just downgraded from Windows 10 to 7 and you miss some features from 10? Here I bring some useful features from Windows 10 and some extras that will give you the Windows 7 best experience

## 1. KatMouse
The main purpose of the KatMouse utility is to be able to scroll in inactive Windows, this is the default behavior in Windows 10.

This is useful when you are working in Word and searching for references on the web, with this tool you wouldn't need to select the Internet window in order to scroll the webpage, so you could still typing in Word while scrolling your chrome tab

#### [Download KatMouse](https://ehiti.de/katmouse/)

## 2. ImDisk ToolKit
ImDisk makes possible to mount virtually any type of archive or image as a drive in Windows. You can mount ISO files, Virtual Disk Drives (VHD, VHDX...)

Windows 8.1 and 10 can mount ISO files automatically by clicking on theme, unfortunately this is not in Windows 7, so with this tool we can mount these files and much more.

It adds entried on the context menu for a fast mount of these files

#### [Download ImDisk Toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/)

## 3. VLC Media Player

This is a must have program in Windows 7 for an addition to Windows Media player, as it doesn't support some formats like m4r, aac, mkv and other audio and video file types

It has a simple design and it works really well. Windows 10 support almost all formats so it doesn't worth at all having VLC on it

## 4. WinRAR

Do I really need to explain this useful program?

Anyways you can have WinRAR with Windows 7 Icons on [Windows - WinRAR](/more/windows?id=winrar)
Downloads are also in that page

## SVG See

To see a SVG Preview in Windows Explorer

#### [Downlaod](https://github.com/tibold/svg-explorer-extension/releases)
