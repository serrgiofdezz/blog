Did you just downgraded from Windows 10 to 7 and you miss some features from 10? Here I bring some useful features from Windows 10 and some extras that will give you the best Windows 7 experience.

## 1. KatMouse
The main purpose of the KatMouse utility is to be able to scroll over inactive windows, this is the default behaviour in Windows 10.

This is useful when you are working in Word and searching for references on the web, with this tool you wouldn't need to select the Internet window in order to scroll the webpage, so you could still typing in Word while scrolling your chrome tab.

## 2. ImDisk ToolKit
ImDisk makes possible to mount virtually any type of archive or image as a drive in Windows. You can mount ISO files, Virtual Disk Drives (VHD, VHDX...)

Windows 8.1 and 10 can mount ISO files automatically by clicking on theme, unfortunately this is not in Windows 7, so with this tool we can mount these files and much more.

It adds entried on the context menu for a fast mount of these files.

## 3. VLC Media Player

This is a must have program in Windows 7 for an addition to Windows Media player, as it doesn't support some formats like m4r, aac, mkv and other audio and video file types.

It has a simple design and it works really well. Windows 10 support almost all formats so it doesn't worth at all having VLC on it.

## 4. Clipboard Master
If you are looking for a clipboard manager with an impressive set of features, this is the tool you want to try first.

With this tool you can store up to 10,000 items. Then we are talking about text, numbers, formulas, images, files and folders. And to ensure that you quickly get to the right item, there is a built-in filter that calls up certain data such as text or images.

## 5. WinRAR

Do I really need to explain this useful program?

Anyways you can have WinRAR with Windows 7 Icons on [Windows - WinRAR](https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/#/more/windows?id=winrar)
Downloads are also in that page.

### [Download WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html?&L=0).

## 6. Eye Saver
Free software for eye protection and more. It protects your eyes while you are working on computer. Eye Saver has three main functions:

1. **Blue light filter:** Filters out the harmful blue light emitted by the display and makes colors warm and easy on the eyes.
2. **No flickering:** Eliminates the invisible flickering of the display backlight, a cause of eye strain and headaches.
3. **Break timer:** Reminds you to take breaks and provides advice on maintaining good health in front of the computer.

## Extra. Office 2010

Wanna get the old but totally functional Office 2010? Get it now.

It works as good as Office 2019, just more aesthetic as it follows Windows 7 Aero Glass design.

It might not have the latest Office features, but personally I prefer this 2010 version. Better designs, way better perfomance and good looking.
