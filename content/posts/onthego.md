# On-The-Go Programs Pack
During my stay in Windows 7, the needs of some programs have arisen. Little by little I have been taking programs and ordering them in a folder. I hope they are helpful.

To have all this programs easily accessible on the Start Menu:

First extract the zip file called On-The-Go on a secure folder, for example your User Folder (C:\Users\%USERNAME%).

Go to the folder **[0] Shortcuts**, copy the shortcuts you want, access the shortcut called **001 - User Start Menu - MOVE HERE**, go to **Programs** and paste them there.
