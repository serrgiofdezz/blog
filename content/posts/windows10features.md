As many of you know, I've been in Widows 7 since Jan 2021, and I'm really enjoying it. However, I found some features that I would love to have in Windows 7 as default.

## 1. Clipboard History

This simple but useful feature built in Windows 10 let you save more than one thing in the clipboard. By pressing Win+V you will see a list of all the things you had copied in the past. It resets on reboot.

#### The Alternative
As I found this tool so useful I decided to give third apps a chance, an I found [**ClipboardMaster**](https://www.clipboardmaster.com/)

It does the same function even better, it let's you copy formatting or without it, copy image and save it as a file, also it let you know from which app the text has been copied. Really recommended.

Download [**ClipboardMaster**](https://www.clipboardmaster.com/).

## 2. Hyper-V

Hyper-V is virtualization software that virtualizes software. It can not only virtualize operating systems but also entire hardware components, such as hard drives and network switches. Unlike Fusion and Virtualbox, Hyper-V is not limited to the user’s device. You can use it for server virtualization, too.

#### The Alternative
Oracle VM VirtualBox does the job in Windows 7. Anyways, Hyper-V has a better performance overall

Download [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

## 3. Night Light

Night light to reduce eye strain and improve sleep, and it's really useful. Windows 10 has this feature built-in. You can enable in the notification center.

On Windows 7 we don't have such feature built-in.

#### The Alternative
Called EyeSaver, and it works even better.

We can modify the brightness and temperature on our own or set the automatic mode. We can also set different light modes depending on the program we are using.

## 4. VHD (Virtual Disk) and ISO Mount Support.
On Windows 10, a virtual hard disk (VHDX or VHD) is a file that can use a ".vhdx" or ".vhd" extension and acts like a physical hard drive, but with the difference that this is a file stored on a real disk.

you can store any files, including documents, pictures, videos, boot files, and an entire OS installation. The only differences between the two formats are that a .vhdx file supports a maximum size of 64TB, features resiliency against power failure, and provides better performance.

Windows 7 support mounting VHD files, but to do so you need to select the file from the **Partitions Manager** tool, so it's kind off difficult.

Also, in Windows 10, by tapping an .ISO file, it automatically mount it and open the folder, not in Windows 7.

#### The Alternative
[ImDisk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/) let you mount any VHD, VHDX, ISO and other file types as easy as Windows 10, by just tapping on it. It also has amazing features as creating driver in the physical memory (RAM). I recommend this program even in Windows 10 for some extra features that this program has.

## 5. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL is a feature that allows to use the Bash of the Linux distribution of your choice, we can have the typical linux directories such as "Home" or "Bin" in Windows and Windows directories in the bash from linux.

This is one of the best features in Windows 10, and I really miss it as I sometimes work with some linux commands.

#### Is there any alternative?
Sadly, I didn't found any alternative to WSL for Windows 7 as it requires changes to its kernel.
