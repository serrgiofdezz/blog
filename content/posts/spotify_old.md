The new Spotify design looks nice, but everything is shifted around. This makes navigating Spotify awful. Fortunately, there is a way to get the old Spotify back.

*Classic VS XPUI Design*

## 1. Downloading and Installing Old Spotify Version
First, you will need to install an old Windows version of Spotify, 1.1.51.380 works for the new and the old design.

* [Download Spotify 1.1.51.380 (Uptodown)](https://spotify.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/3173791) / [Google Drive Mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Le-xGlZvI9ZN9we46QSSU4mWgReXyBnm/view?usp=sharing)

Once download, install the program. When Spotify opens, close it instantly.

## 2. Block Automatic Updates

Go to your AppData folder, by opening Windows Explorer. Then navigate to **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Spotify**.

Once there, create a new folder called **Update**. Now open the folder properties and navigate to **Security** tab.

Tap **Edit** and deny full control for all users and administrators, including **SYSTEM**, click Apply and exit.

Now the Spotify app won't be able to push the temp files in the *Update* folder in order to update the program to a newer version.

## 3. Enabling Classic UI

This version have the XPUI design as default, but still have the old UI resources, so you just need to enable it.

Navigate to **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Spotify**

Find the file called **prefs**

Open the file (with notepad or any other text editor).

You will see some properties, just go the end of the file, and create a new line with the following text:

```prefs
ui.experience_override="classic"
```

Save the file and exit.

Now open Spotify, sign in, and done! You now have the old Spotify UI, with better tools, key shortcuts, and in my opinion, a better design.
